	<p>My name is Jonathan Edradan and thank you for dropping by my page.  This is my first attempt to creating my own website so please bare with me.  As I continue on my quest to become a software engineer, this website will expand in its simplicity and reflect what I have learned throughout my journey.  So... let me start off by telling you a little more about me. I would like to think of my self as a sports enthusiast... I am an advanced open water diver, I have completed two marathons, an amateur triathlete and a die hard San Francisco 49ers fan.  Professionally, I have spent most of my career working for the United States Government, 8 years as a U.S. Marine and 6 years contracting in support of the Department of Defense.</p>
